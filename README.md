# usc_dsa_mcpe631
Data Structure and Algorithms Course Refresher

## Clone the Project
```bash
git clonegit@github.com:jklpdgoat/usc_dsa_mcpe631.git
```

## Run the Development Environment Script (Assuming nix binary is installed)
We can have a different shell on our new Dev Environment by replacing {shell} with
our preferred one such as: bash, zsh, fish, nushell, etc. 

`nix-shell --run {shell}`

Since I use zsh:
```bash
nix-shell --run zsh
```

This is just a barebone Dev Env Setup for small projects. As we go through the course,
we will be updating this to a flake file.
